To see this video of the 2 episodes in it, disc burning is required.
To burn a disc, you need a blank DVD, and a computer with a DVD/CD player.
First, insert the blank disc.
Then, a notification will pop up. Press it, then select "Burn files to disc".
Press "Use DVD/CD Player"
Then, it will open your File Explorer.
Open File Explorer again, then right click the ISO file you downloaded.
If you don't see the ISO file, you might've not extracted the zip file. If you don't have the ISO file itself, download it at https://www.mediafire.com/file/3h88c4vx54a6jxj/ROBLOXAnimatedSeriesDisc.zip/file
so you can extract the files.
After you right clicked the ISO file, click Burn to disc. Then press the button to burn the disc.
Eject the disc, and put it in any DVD player and enjoy the show!
